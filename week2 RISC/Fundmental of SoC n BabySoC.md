# System-on-Chip (SoC) Design Fundamentals and the Role of BabySoC

## What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit that combines multiple computer system components into a single chip. This compact design is essential for modern devices like smartphones, tablets, wearables, and IoT gadgets, where space, energy efficiency, and performance are critical. By integrating diverse functional units, SoCs enable smaller, cost-effective, energy-efficient, and high-performance devices with enhanced reliability.
