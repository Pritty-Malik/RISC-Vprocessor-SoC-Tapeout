# RISC-Vprocessor-SoC-Tapeout

RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

Welcome to my journey through the SoC Tapeout Program VSD!
This repository documents my week-by-week progress with tasks inside each week.

📅 Week 0 — Setup & Tools
Task 	Description 	Status
Task 0 	🛠️ Tools Installation — Installed Iverilog, Yosys, and gtkWave 	✅ Done
🌟 Key Learnings from Week 0

    Installed and verified open-source EDA tools successfully.
    Learned about basic environment setup for RTL design and synthesis.
    Prepared the system for upcoming RTL → GDSII flow experiments.

🙏 Acknowledgment

I am thankful to Kunal Ghosh and Team VLSI System Design (VSD) for the opportunity to participate in the ongoing RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program.

I also acknowledge the support of RISC-V International, India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), VLSI Society of India (VSI), and Efabless for making this initiative possible.
