# RISC-Vprocessor-SoC-Tapeout

## Welcome to my journey through the SoC Tapeout Program VSD!
This repository documents my week-by-week progress with tasks inside each week.

### Week 0 — Setup & Tools
| Task                 | Description                                                     | Status |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Task 0 / Week 0      | Tools Installation — Installed Iverilog, Yosys, and gtkWave     | Done   |
| Task 1/ week 1/Day1  | 2:1 MUX output waveform and RTL diagram     (gtkwave & yosys)   | Done   | 
| Task 2/ week 1/Day2  | D- flip Flop output waveform and RTL diagram(gtkwave & yosys)   | Done   |


**Key Learnings from Week 0**

    Installed and verified open-source EDA tools successfully.
    Learned about basic environment setup for RTL design and synthesis.
    Prepared the system for upcoming RTL → GDSII flow experiments.
