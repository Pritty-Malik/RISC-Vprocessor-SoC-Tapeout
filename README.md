# RISC-Vprocessor-SoC-Tapeout

## Welcome to my journey through the SoC Tapeout Program VSD!
This repository documents my week-by-week progress with tasks inside each week.

### Week 0 — Setup & Tools
| Task                 | Description                                                     | Status |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Task 0 / Week 0      | Tools Installation — Installed Iverilog, Yosys, and gtkWave     | Done   |
| Task 1/ week 1/Day1  | 2:1 MUX output waveform and RTL diagram     (gtkwave & yosys) (Week 1  Day 1) [RISC-Vprocessor-SoC-Tapeout/(Week 1 Day 1) 2to1 MUX /2to1mux guide.md] | Done   | 
| Task 2/ week 1/Day2| D- flip Flop output waveform and RTL diagram(gtkwave & yosys) (Week 1  Day 2)     [RISC-Vprocessor-SoC-Tapeout/(Week 1 Day 2) D- Flip Flop (Synch Asynch Set Reset)/D-Flip flop guide.md]|Done   |
| Task 3/ week 1/Day3| Opt_check single / multiple, counter_opt, counter_opt2, dff_const4, dff_const5 |Done   |
| Task 4/ week 1/Day4|Blocking and non-blocking statements for GLS, Synthesis-simulation Mismatch|Done   |
| Task 5/ week 1/Day5|Conditional and cases|Done   |
| Task 6 / week 2|SoC and Baby SoC [https://github.com/Pritty13/RISC-Vprocessor-SoC-Tapeout/tree/Pritty13-Week2-SoC-RISC-V-Processor]|Done |

**Key Learnings from Week 0**

    Installed and verified open-source EDA tools successfully.
    Learned about basic environment setup for RTL design and synthesis.
    Prepared the system for upcoming RTL → GDSII flow experiments.
