# RISC-Vprocessor-SoC-Tapeout

## Welcome to my journey through the SoC Tapeout Program VSD!
This repository documents my week-by-week progress with tasks inside each week.

### Week 0 — Setup & Tools
| Task                 | Description                                                     | Status |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Task 0 / Week 0      | Tools Installation — Installed Iverilog, Yosys, and gtkWave     | Done   |
| Task 1/ week 1/Day1  | 2:1 MUX output waveform and RTL diagram     (gtkwave & yosys) (Week 1  Day 1) RISC-Vprocessor-SoC-Tapeout/(Week 1 Day 1) 2to1 MUX /2to1mux guide.md | Done   | 
| Task 2/ week 1/Day2| D- flip Flop output waveform and RTL diagram(gtkwave & yosys) (Week 1  Day 2)     RISC-Vprocessor-SoC-Tapeout/(Week 1 Day 2) D- Flip Flop (Synch Asynch Set Reset)/D-Flip flop guide.md|Done   |



**Key Learnings from Week 0**

    Installed and verified open-source EDA tools successfully.
    Learned about basic environment setup for RTL design and synthesis.
    Prepared the system for upcoming RTL → GDSII flow experiments.
